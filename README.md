1. PCA - Pricipal component Analysis
It helps to simplify complex data. PCA helps make large data easier to work with, especially when you have lots of details but only a few matter most.

2. Linear Regression
Its like drawing the best-fitting straight line through a scatterplot of points.
this line helps us predict future points.
Its very useful for understanding and predicting relationships. eg: predicting your height based on age.

3. KNN - K-Nearest Neighbour
its like finding the friend who are closest match. You pick a point and look at the closest neighbours (K of them) out what group or category it should belong to.
KNN is easy to understand and great for classification tasks.

4. Unsupervised Learning
Its helps when you want to find hidden patterns or groupings in data without knowing categories upfront.
its like exploring new place without the map. You dont have any labeled data to start with; instead, you let the data reveal patterns on its own.

5. K-means Clustering
K means groups data into "K" clusters. Its like putting all similar objects into k different buckets.
Its useful for organizing data into natural group when you dont know the label.

6. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is like training with a coach. The data you're give has labels, and you're learning to match data to labels.
This is useful for tasks whre you already know the outcome(eg; predicting weather)

7. Hypothesis Testing
its like testing a guess or hunch about data. You're trying to prove or disprove the theory. 
The is key in data science is for making confident decisions based on data.

8. Support vector Machine(SVM)
SVM is a method that draws a line (or boundary) between different groups of data. It tries to find the best line that seperates different categories.
its powerful for complex classification problems.

9. Decision Tree
A decision tree is like flowchart with branches. Each branch represents a choice leading to a result.
its easy to visualize and understand how decisions are made on data.

10. Random Forest
A Random Forest is a group of decisions trees working together to improve accuracy.
Its more accurate and robust than a single decision tree because it averages multiple trees.

11. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is like training a dog with rewards. The algorithm learns by getting rewards or penalties based on actions.
Its perfect for situations where decisions need to be made in stages, like games.
